# Ecommerce-Customer-Spending-Analysis
Data analysis and predictive modeling to help an Ecommerce company optimize its mobile app and website for increased customer spending

Overview

This repository contains a data analysis and predictive modeling project for an Ecommerce company that sells clothing online and offers in-store style advice sessions. The goal is to determine whether the company should focus on improving its mobile app experience or website to increase the Yearly Amount Spent per customer, or if another aspect (e.g., membership length) is more critical.

Project Description
The project uses a dataset (Ecommerce_Customers.csv) with information about customers, including:

Average session length of in-store style advice sessions
Time spent on the mobile app
Time spent on the website
Length of membership
Yearly amount spent (target variable)
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations, followed by two predictive models:

Simple Linear Regression: Using Length of Membership as the primary predictor.
Multivariate Linear Regression: Incorporating multiple features to assess their combined impact.
Installation
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Install the required libraries using pip:



pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-customer-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd ecommerce-customer-analysis
Ensure the Ecommerce_Customers.csv file is in the directory (download it from the provided source or use the included dataset if available).
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Ecommerce_Customer_Analysis.ipynb

Follow the notebook cells to execute the analysis and view results.
Results
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified key correlations (e.g., Length of Membership strongly correlates with Yearly Amount Spent).
Model Performance: The multivariate model outperformed the simple model, with a lower MSE and higher RÂ² score.
Recommendation: The company should prioritize enhancing the mobile app experience and customer retention strategies to boost spending.
Files
Ecommerce_Customer_Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and modeling code.
